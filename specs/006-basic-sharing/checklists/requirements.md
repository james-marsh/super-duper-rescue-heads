- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows

**Key Strengths**:
- Comprehensive edge case coverage (invitation expiration, max collaborators, concurrent edits)
- Clear permission boundaries (View Only vs Can Edit)
- Security considerations (token expiration, single-use links, policy-based authorization)
- Real-time sync requirements with acceptable SLA (5 seconds)
- Audit log for action attribution

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.tasks`
